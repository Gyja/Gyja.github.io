# About XLCloud

XLcloud has the battle scars and the experience to help you with your Cloud adoption. We were not born in the cloud. We are much older than the cloud and all the unique transformations that AWS can bring to your organisation. 

As a result, we are able to work with more than the modern DNB (Digital Native Business) but our experiance allows us to work with the Enterprises in this world. We can help with all those questions and approaches including - "How do I step into the cloud when I am already running a $100 million dollar company on prem?"

# Our Focus

We focus on three key areas of cloud, specifically AWS:

## Cost optimisation / FinOps 

Our AWS staff are specialists in the field of finding areas for optimization, especially around cost. From “low hanging fruit” all the way to supporting you with contract negotiation that will give you significant savings allowing you to focus on you, the business and what you can deliver to your customers. 

## Cloud Transformation

Whatever your business objectives, the adoption of cloud services can help focus on achieving those objectives with greater efficiency and cadence. We can support that journey with readiness assessments and migration or greenfield deployment projects. Cloud is a lot more than technology. Cloud is a mindset change, a paradigm shift and here at XLCloud, we can take you through each step of your journey.  

## Technical architecture 

With many decades of computing experience and over 13 years of AWS cloud experience under our belt, if you’re looking to embark on a significant program of work or need some experienced technical ownership and oversight, we are here to help. The conversation will always start with the business requirements and then start looking at the technical requirements to be fulfilled. We will design efficient, cost-effective technical solutions both big and small. We will ensure that we work closely with your business stakeholders to help evangelise the business and technical objectives and deliver on reliable, secure and trusted solutions.
