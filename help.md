# How can we help?

We help our customers *really* understand AWS, both technically and understanding the underlying messaging (culture),  working backwards from the business value. The technology is the replaceable part! 

## C Suite - The visionaries

From working backwards from the business objectives, understanding the mindset shift, getting to grips with the Amazon culture, we can:

* Determine business objectives:  
    Cloud Transformation can only deliver value if it aligns with business needs (discovery exercises, stakeholder communications, culture etc.). Working with stakeholders from across the organisation, understand your company’s business goals: where it is now, where it wants to be and the future.

* Create your cloud strategy: 
    The cloud strategy must start from and align with the business’s needs and objectives, or working backwards as Amazon coined the phrase. Your strategy should address business objectives and should rest on a solid fundamental understanding of the company’s needs, financial and technical constraights, capabilities and key milestones/delivery timelines.
 
* So many technologies (Services/Products):  
    We help you choose the solutions that will deliver long-term value, scalability and flexibility. All too often we see that those in charge of cloud migration let the others, normally Engineers lead the strategy. This is the tail (Technical) wagging the dog (Business). Your business goals should determine the choice of technologies, platform and provider. 

* Building teams: 
    Finding the people with the skills in your organisation is key for the delivery of your visions on your Cloud Transformation.  We can help with this process of establishing if you have the right skills and qualifications you need to deliver your cloud transformation. Decide which roles you can fill in-house, which require the upskilling of existing staff, which need new hires and which should be outsourced.

## Finance team  - The bastions

XLCloud brings a deep understanding and transparency of your AWS bills. 

From “WTaF is that!?” a discovery of those elements that lead to that “Shock bill” to a strategic view on managing the costs going forward. 

Amazon Web services is huge and complex at the best of times, and we bring expertise and clarity to what often looks as clear as mud. 

* Awareness and a common vocabulary:
    More often than not, in our experience, the teams responsible for understanding the spend are not aware of the cloud and what it delivers. By educating around these elements with your teams, we can assist your finance teams to understand what these bills mean and how to help make them have more contextual. This brings better cohesion to between teams; cost and deployment. 

* In bringing more transparency as well as a deeper understanding of what all these billing SKU’s are for the Finance team, we can remove a lot of the FUD (Fear, uncertainty, doubt) on your AWS environment. 
* We can educate the engineering teams to better understand what your requirements are which leads to a better trust in the spend on AWS. 

* Bringing and common understanding between the teams, (C-Suite vision, Engineering talent, Finance),  together with the information shared by all parties adds context to your relationship with Amazon. This context all adds to a narrative that we can work with Amazon to negotiate better spending deals on AWS. Do this once you have done all the business and technical optimisation, trust me - it saves tears in beers.

## Engineering teams - The builders


### Through the looking glass 

We work with your teams to advise on the technical elements that would allow them to understand and instrument the costs associated in delivery against the business objectives. Forewarned is forearmed, so at the very least you will be able to bear witness to the increasing costs. 

Having data points is the first step in gaining information - > Knowledge -> Wisdom.  

By working with the Engineering teams and laying the foundational elements around cost, they can focus on building out your business deliverables whilst you can monitor the costs associated with the development. 

From right sizing instances, picking the right tools/services for the job to tweaking networking configurations we can empower your engineering teams to ensure that they are considering both the financial and environmental elements to lower your costs both in the short term and establish a way of working to ensure that these costs remain as optimised going forward. Less bill shock and more value.
